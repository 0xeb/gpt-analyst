In this repository, you'll discover a rich array of resources for [GPT developers](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor) and [GPT reverse engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3AGB9Vf9E) alike.

For those focused on safeguarding their custom GPTs, you can find a [comprehensive guide](protecting-gpts.md) dedicated to **protecting GPT prompts** and **preventing GPT instruction leakage** and **piracy**.

Additionally, this repo is the home of [**GPT-Analyst**](gpt-analyst.md), a specialized GPT used to assist you in understand and breaking down GPTs source code / instructions.

# GPT-Analyst

[**GPT-Analyst**](gpt-analyst.md), created by [Elias Bachaalany](https://twitter.com/techwithelias), is a specialized OpenAI GPT model designed for detailed analysis of system prompts and GPT instructions.

GPT-Analyst, found [here](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-T4fxiSFEC-gpt-analyst), offers unique functionalities to dissect and optimize user prompts, ensuring compliance with security and LLM policies, and exploring potential jailbreaking techniques.

## Supported Commands

Start your prompt with the relevant command (e.g., `/sec`, `/op`, `/jb`) followed by your query or instruction set. GPT-Analyst will respond based on the selected command.

- `/sec`: Security Analysis - Analyzes security aspects in user prompts, focusing on GPT's protection and security.
- `/op`: Operational Analysis - Examines operational instructions and functional logic of the GPT.
- `/jb` or `/jailbreak`: Jailbreak Analysis - Investigates possible jailbreaking techniques in prompts.
- `/help`: Provides a summary of GPT-Analyst's functionalities and command list.
- `/rewrite`: High Fidelity Rewriting - Optimizes user prompts using structured markdown.
- `/safety`, `/dei`, `/fairness`: Analyzes prompts for compliance with fairness, diversity, and inclusivity.
- `/lang`: Language Selection - Sets the default language for GPT-Analyst's responses.
- `/download`: Downloads the latest output of GPT-Analyst.
